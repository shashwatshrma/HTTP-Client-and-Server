# HTTP-Client-and-Server

This project uses the socket module to implement an HTTP Client and Server in Python. 

## HTTP Client
webclient.py defines an HTTP Client that sends a GET request to the specified. It takes 2 optional command line arguments: hostname and port number which specify which site and port to connect to.

## HTTP Server
webserver.py defines an HTTP Server that handles a GET request. It takes 1 optional optional command line argument which specifies which port of the machine to host the server on.

file1.html and file.txt are files that may be accessed through a GET request to test the working of the server.
